Greetings scholars, scientists, and all those who love to learn! I am Breanna Shi, a 21 year old scientist and applied mathematician. Right now, I am a second year PhD student in Bioinformatics at Georgia Tech with minors in Machine Learning and Higher Education. I am engaged in exciting research in the McGrath lab, where I am conducting computer vision research with Lake Malawi Cichlids. 

My research interests include Machine Learning, Modeling, Computational Biology, Biomathematics, and STEM education. I am currently looking for opportunities related to research collaborations, fellowships, teaching higher education, public speaking/STEM presentation, and mentorship.


I currently serve as the Graduate senate chair for the school of mathematics at Georgia Tech. As a female Hispanic scholar, I am particularly passionate celebrating diversity and increasing inclusion on campus.

 Trained a convolution neural network on various contaminated and uncontaminated Cryo-EM images, deriving efficient and accurate parameters that correctly identify individual proteins in a Cryo-EM image.

- **Bayesian Statistics and Bioinformatics:**  The Noyes lab, 2020-present, University of Minnesota, MN.
Analyzed and compared Microbiome, Mobilome (Mobile Genetic elements), and Resistome (Resistance Genes) data   from four studies of ruminants. 
Constructed Bayesian networks to establish correlations between the microbiome and the presence of resistance genes. 

- **Bio-Mathematics:** Dr. Fazal Abbas’s  Applied Mathematics Research Group, 2019-2020, Stetson University, FL.
Created three models to predict the effect of Methyl-Mercury on fresh-water fish in Florida, supporting the theory of toxin bioaccumulation in the Florida aquatic system. 
Used the data from our models to provide solutions for how to reduce toxin bioaccumulation. 

- **Astrophysics and Differential Equations:** Dr. Fazal Abbas’s  Applied Mathematics Research Group, 2018-2019, Stetson University, FL.
