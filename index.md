## Breanna Shi (She/Her)
## Applied Mathematician, Computer scientist, Bioinformatician, Georgia Tech PhD Student


Greetings scholars, scientists, and all those who love to learn! I am Breanna Shi, a 21 year old scientist and applied mathematician. Right now, I am a second year PhD student in Bioinformatics at Georgia Tech with minors in Machine Learning and Higher Education. I am engaged in exciting research in the McGrath lab, where I am conducting computer vision research with Lake Malawi Cichlids. 

My research interests include Machine Learning, Modeling, Computational Biology, Biomathematics, and STEM education. I am currently looking for opportunities related to research collaborations, fellowships, teaching higher education, public speaking/STEM presentation, and mentorship.


I currently serve as the Graduate senate chair for the school of mathematics at Georgia Tech. As a female Hispanic scholar, I am particularly passionate celebrating diversity and increasing inclusion on campus. 

Questions and comments are always welcome!
